* No more ChangeLog files

  Do not modify any of the ChangeLog files in Libassuan.  Starting
  on December 12st, 2011 we put change information only in the GIT
  commit log, and generate a top-level ChangeLog file from logs at
  "make dist" time.  As such, there are strict requirements on the
  form of the commit log messages.  The old ChangeLog files have all
  be renamed to ChangeLog-2011


* Commit log requirements

  Your commit log should always start with a one-line summary, the
  second line should be blank, and the remaining lines are usually
  ChangeLog-style entries for all affected files.  However, it's fine
  -- even recommended -- to write a few lines of prose describing the
  change, when the summary and ChangeLog entries don't give enough of
  the big picture.  Omit the leading TABs that you're used to seeing
  in a "real" ChangeLog file, but keep the maximum line length at 72
  or smaller, so that the generated ChangeLog lines, each with its
  leading TAB, will not exceed 80 columns.

  If you want to add extra text to the commit log which shall not be
  copied to the ChangeLog, use a separator consisting of two dashes at
  the start of a line (optionally followed by white space).
