files, to verify signatures and to manage the private and public keys.

Installation under a Unix like operating system
===============================================

You need development versins of the GTK+ and GPGME libraries.
See the file INSTALL for installation details; in short:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The configure scripts check whether all required libraries are
installed and that they are recent enough.  In order to do anything
useful with GPA you also need the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) version 2
installed - see https://gnupg.org.


Installation under MS-Windows
=============================

Instead of building GPA by yourself, you probably want to download
the ready-to-use installer from https://www.gpg4win.org, the light
installer is sufficient, don't you? ;-)

If you want to do it your self, you need to have the Windows
development version of all libraries already installed on your box.
GPA may only be build using a cross compiler.  It is best to install
all windows stuff under a tree like ~/w32root with the usual bin, lib
and include directories.  If you did this you merely need to run

  ./autogen.sh --build-w32
  make
  make install

The autogen.sh script invoked this way calls configure with all
required arguments.  Check the script to see how to adjust to your own
environment.


Have fun!
